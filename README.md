## General Information
    Background: This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various environmental and seasonal factors.
    Business Problem: To optimize bike availability and service levels based on predicted demand, thereby improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
    Dataset: Utilizing a dataset containing variables such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and seasonal indicators, alongside historical bike rental counts.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
        Conclusion 1 : Features such as temperature (temp), humidity (hum), and wind speed (windspeed) contribute to predicting bike rental demand, though their individual impacts vary.
        Conclusion 2: The features year (yr_1) and seasonal indicators (season_2, season_3, season_4) exhibit significant impacts on bike rental demand, highlighting the influence of time-related factors.
